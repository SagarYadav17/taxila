A small sample of Bianco Sardo granite is usually representative not having a wide variation in colour and veining however swatch samples must be approved for large projects to ensure that the blocks are all extracted from the same quarry face for matching purposes. During the polishing process a clear epoxy resin filler may be used to fill any micro fissures or tiny pitting however this does not affect the integrity of the stone, it merely provides an even smoother surface finish. Bianco Sardo granite is suitable for both interior and exterior use futhermore is frost resistant and with a constant polish.",
